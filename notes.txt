Step 1 — Data prep (college dataset): load → clean exactly like your prior lab pipeline (types, drops, one-hot, scaling) and fix the split so it’s stratified on the binary target (this is the “3 points off” feedback you got).

Step 2 — Baseline kNN (k=3): fit kNN on train, predict probabilities on test.

Step 3 — Results dataframe: build a dataframe with actual, predicted, probability.

Step 4 — Concept question (no code): explain how changing k affects the “threshold function” and confusion matrix behavior.

Step 5 — Confusion matrix + interpretation: evaluate and discuss whether the model answers your question well.

Step 6 — Two functions:

Function A: clean + split (stratified)

Function B: train/test with adjustable k and threshold

Step 7 — Optimization: loop over k + thresholds, compare performance.
